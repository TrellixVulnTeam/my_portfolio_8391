        <div class="card-header">
          <p>Hi everyone. My name is Pavol Medved, I am 32 years old, originaly from Slovakia. On my journey of life, I learned how to be patient, respectful, hard worker and kind. Life is full of experiences and is up to us, what kind skills we will take advantage of. I grew up in very simple family, but full of love. My city has around 600 people. For me as a person who has big dreams and like adventures was almost abnormal stay home, and don't look in to the big world. So I decided to travel. I lived in couple years in England, visited some beautiful places in Europe, but 4,5 years ago I moved to USA. This step was big decision in my life.</p>

          <h2 class="card-title">...why i decided become a web developer</h2>
          <p class="card-text">I feel like i would like to know everything in my life. If someone will ask me, would you like to go to the space? For sure my answer will be yes. From all my work experiences i try to learned best how i can. Some jobs were easy, some of them stresfull and other just boring. I worked in warehouses, stores, hotels and restaurants, learned how to make cars, i did tray job as caregiver or painter. Bakaing or cooking never was problem for me to. When i was younger i was feeling is not good to know evrything and i shodul focus on one thing. But im glad i did try many jobs i can becasue now is much easy apply in life and becomme successful. Everything is in your hand and your mind. Thats mean everything you can do if you really want. However, I worked hard, always following my instinct and not just taking positive things out of work, but negative. Because of the mizaintereses we can learn and look forward to. I can say about my own; I am a person when work is losing power interesting and becoming a stereotype, then it is difficult to focus on my goal. My goal is to learn the power I can in my life, that's why I decided to become a web developer. Becasue in this work you realize every day something new, and this job never gives you a feeling of dull. You have to be creative every day, and learn every day. Its a big chelange!</p>
